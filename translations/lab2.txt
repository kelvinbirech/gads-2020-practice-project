LAB:Console and Cloud Shell

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:


 *Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.
 *Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.
 *Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.

Task 1: Create a bucket using the Cloud Console

gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME> 
replace the BUCKET NAME with globally unique name

Task 2: Create a bucket using Cloud Shell
Open Cloud Shell
1. Use the gsutil command to create another bucket. Replace <BUCKET_NAME> with a globally unique name 

gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>

2. Upload a file
Open Cloud Shell.

Click the three dots icon in the Cloud Shell toolbar to display further options.

Click Upload file. Upload any file from your local machine to the Cloud Shell VM. This file will be referred to as [MY_FILE].

In Cloud Shell, type ls to confirm that the file was uploaded.

3. Copy the file into one of the buckets you created earlier in the lab. Replace [MY_FILE] with the file you uploaded and [BUCKET_NAME] with one of your bucket names:

gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

Task3 : Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell

Identify available regions
4. Open Cloud Shell from the Cloud Console. Note that this allocates a new VM for you.

To list available regions, execute the following command:

gcloud compute regions list


5. Select a region from the list and note the value in any text editor. This region will now be referred to as [YOUR_REGION] in the remainder of the lab.
6. Create and verify an environment variable

Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step:

INFRACLASS_REGION=[YOUR_REGION]


7. Verify it with echo:

echo $INFRACLASS_REGION



Append the environment variable to a file
8. Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class:

mkdir infraclass


9. Create a file called config in the infraclass directory:

touch infraclass/config


10. Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:

echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config


11. Create a second environment variable for your Project ID, replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID. You can find the project ID on the Cloud Console Home page.

INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]


12. Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file:

echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config


13. Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:

source infraclass/config
echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID


This gives you a method to create environment variables and to easily recreate them if the Cloud Shell is cycled. However, you will still need to remember to issue the source command each time Cloud Shell is opened.

14. Close and re-open Cloud Shell. Then issue the echo command again:

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID


There will be no output because the environment variable no longer exists.

15. Modify the bash profile and create persistence
Edit the shell profile with the following command:

nano .profile

16. Add the following line to the end of the file:

source infraclass/config


Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

17. Close and then re-open Cloud Shell to cycle the VM.

18. Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set:

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
You should now see the expected value that you set in the config file.
