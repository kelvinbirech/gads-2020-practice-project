Lab:Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine
Objectives
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
* Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
* Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
* Connect between the two instances.

STEPS
Create a virtual machine using the GCP Console
Copy and paste the following command in  cloud shell;
gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-1"  --machine-type "n1-standard-1"  --image-project "debian-cloud"  --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213"  --subnet "default" -- tags http
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http  -- action=ALLOW --destination=INGRESS--rules=http:80 --target tags=http


Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line

Open cloud shell and  paste the command below to set your default zone to the one you just chose and create another instance.

gcloud config set compute/zone [followed by the zone you chose].
gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"



Connect between VM instances
1. Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:

Connect to my-vm-2
Gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2

2. Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:

ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2 and Press Ctrl+C to abort the ping command.

Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:

ssh my-vm-1 If you are prompted about whether you want to continue connecting to a host with unknown authenticity, enter yes to confirm that you do.

3. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:

sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y


4. Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:

sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html


5. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:

Hi from YOUR_NAME


Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.

6. Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

curl http://localhost/


The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.

7. To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

exit


You will return to the command prompt on my-vm-2

8. To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:

curl http://my-vm-1/


The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
